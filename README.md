# movie-watchlist

Hey! This is a movie watchlist project I am working on using the OMDB API found here: https://www.omdbapi.com/
It is a neat little app that will allow you to search for movies and add them to your watch list so you can go back later and enjoy them. It implements local storage to save data to display on the watchlist page. It also implements API calls to be able to get lists of movies and another call using the selected movies id to call the API to be able to save the specific movie to local storage.
